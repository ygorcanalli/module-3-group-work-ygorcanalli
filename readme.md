* Exercise 1:

1. On the command line, create repository for Module 3 and a readme file.
2. On GitHub.com, create a module 3 repo and add it as a remote.
3. In your terminal, create a new branch with a questions.md document, and write down any remaining questions you have about pull requests.
4. Add a remote tracking branch and push to it.
5. On GitHub.com, open a pull request with the branch that has your questions--you can mention me @mozzadrella as a reviewer or in the comments to answer them. 
6. Post a screenshot of your pull request to the forums.
